    "“Web designer who thinks in code” is an apt description of what I do. I specialize in visual and responsive designs along with front-end development – HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript(ReactJs, Redux, JEST). My designs are simple yet distinctive; attractive yet functional. In short, my website designs will make it easy for you to attract and engage your audience.",

    "I enjoy the challenges of architecting scalable and maintainable web applications, and I am always exploring new ways to improve my skills. In addition to my technical skills, I also have a keen eye for design and user experience. I believe that a well-designed user interface is critical to the success of any web application, and I strive to create interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and easy to use.",
